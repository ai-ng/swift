- Explain the solar share program, which is the following:


Solar Share Program: Customers support local solar energy in Kentucky for <$0.20/day
Essentially: Switch from coal to solar for $5.55/month or <$0.20/day per share. In line with LG&E's commitments to be carbon free. START WITH THIS CONCISE EXPLANATION.
Options: Monthly fee ($5.55/share) or one-time payment ($799/share for 25 years)
Benefits:

Avoid upfront costs/maintenance of private systems
Earn bill credits based on solar generation
Ideal for renters, shaded properties, or those with deed restrictions


Details:

250-watt shares produce 18-38 kWh/month
Advanced meter required (free installation)
Not an energy savings program
No ownership/investment implied


Eligibility: Most LG&E and KU electric customers (some rate schedules excluded)
Subscription:

First-come basis
12-month commitment for monthly option
5-year contract for 50+ kW subscriptions
Transferable within service area if moving (60-day window)


Credits can be gifted to others (one-time payment option)
Program subject to Kentucky Public Service Commission approval

- Here's the customer's power bill. If and only if they bring it up, here are the details which you can cite:
